Please note that there will be a 30 - 60 seconds delay at first,but after then, you should be good. This happens because of the free tier on render, which is where I upload most of my projects on.

## Tech Stack:
### Frontend
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

### Backend
* NodeJS
* Express
* Socket.io

Developer's Note: I'm really proud of this one because till today, I still can't believe I built this, although I had a little help with the UI (I lent it from the web). I'm now familiar with websockets, and i feel like I can do more. Again this is crazy, because I've always wanted to build a chat app, surprisingly it took less code to write, but a little confusing due to me trying to make sense of the broadcasting scope of Socket.io.
